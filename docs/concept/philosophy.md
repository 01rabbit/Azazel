# Philosophy

Azazel System embodies **delaying action** and the martial concept of **後の先 (Go-no-Sen)**. We accept limited harm to a sacrificial surface to protect critical assets and lives.

- **Sustainable Active Cyber Defense**: intervene with proportional, logged, and reversible controls to avoid burnout and escalation.
- **Scapegoat Gateway**: a designated target that absorbs, shapes, and studies adversary pressure without exposing the crown jewels.
