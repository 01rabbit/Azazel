# Azazel System
**Cyber Scapegoat Gateway** — delaying action to buy time, mislead adversaries, and keep civilians and operators safe.

Azazel System is the upstream of **Azazel-Pi** and **Azazel-Zero**. It defines the philosophy, tactics, architecture, shared event schema, and operational modes (Portal / Shield / Lockdown).

- **Why**: When resources are scarce and chaos is plenty, time is the only currency that matters.
- **How**: Detect, deceive, delay. Shape adversary tempo and preserve defender initiative.
- **Where**: Edge gateways, pop-up shelters, field ops, and beyond.
