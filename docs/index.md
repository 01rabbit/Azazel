# Azazel System

[English](/docs/index.md) | [日本語](/docs/index_ja.md)

## Azazel System is rooted in two key Japanese strategic doctrines

- The Imperial Japanese Army’s principle of battlefield containment—not simply blocking the enemy, but intentionally binding them to a location to limit their actions and buy time for reinforcements or counteroffensives.

- The martial arts concept of "Go no Sen", or taking initiative in response. Rather than preemptive strikes, this principle capitalizes on the opponent's move, using their momentum against them. Azazel embodies this by activating its response only after intrusion is detected, deliberately reacting to the attacker’s behavior to assert control.

These principles converge in Azazel’s design: defense is not about passive protection, but about active control and strategic delay.

---
Azazel System is the upstream of **Azazel-Pi** and **Azazel-Zero**. It defines the philosophy, tactics, architecture, shared event schema, and operational modes (Portal / Shield / Lockdown).

- **Why**: When resources are scarce and chaos is plenty, time is the only currency that matters.
- **How**: Detect, deceive, delay. Shape adversary tempo and preserve defender initiative.
- **Where**: Edge gateways, pop-up shelters, field ops, and beyond.
